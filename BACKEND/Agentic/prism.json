I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. If the trigger does not return any output, then the first agent need not be a llm. directly start the main workflow with any agent.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Try to atomize the data flowing between agents into smaller parts to avoid confusion and use them as inputs to the tools. example :- mail_content have sender email, buyer name, product name, quantity, so keep all 4 also in data flow notebook instead of mail_content.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Create an email monitoring workflow that integrates Gmail and Google Docs with a Notion database.  The workflow should trigger when a new email arrives in Gmail.  If the email concerns a product order, extract the following information: buyer name, address, contact details, email address, product name(s), and product quantity(ies).  If multiple products are listed, create a separate row in the Notion database for each product.  If product details are in an attachment, extract them from the attachment.  For each order, retrieve vendor contact information from a specified Google Doc. Finally, compose and send an email to the vendor outlining the order requirements.  The workflow should handle cases where product details are missing or ambiguous, using an LLM to fill in missing information where possible.\n",

Reasoning llm : specialized in reasoning and deep thinking. input : llm_prompt. output : reasoning_output (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. If the trigger does not return any output, then the first agent need not be a llm. directly start the main workflow with any agent.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Try to atomize the data flowing between agents into smaller parts to avoid confusion and use them as inputs to the tools. example :- mail_content have sender email, buyer name, product name, quantity, so keep all 4 also in data flow notebook instead of mail_content.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Design an agentic workflow that monitors new emails in Gmail for emails containing product orders. Upon detecting a product order email, extract the following information: buyer name, address, contact details, email address, product name(s), and quantity(ies) from the email body and any attachments.  If multiple products are listed, create a separate row in a Notion database for each product. If information is missing or ambiguous, use a Large Language Model (LLM) to fill in the gaps.  Retrieve vendor contact information from a specified Google Doc.  Compose and send an email to the vendor detailing the order requirements.  After receiving a vendor email regarding order availability and delivery time, send an acknowledgement email to the buyer. The workflow should not use Zapier or similar tools.\n",

Reasoning llm : specialized in reasoning and deep thinking. input : llm_prompt. output : reasoning_output (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. If the trigger does not return any output, then the first agent need not be a llm. directly start the main workflow with any agent.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Try to atomize the data flowing between agents into smaller parts to avoid confusion and use them as inputs to the tools. example :- mail_content have sender email, buyer name, product name, quantity, so keep all 4 also in data flow notebook instead of mail_content.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Design an email automation workflow triggered by new Gmail messages labeled \"gmail_new_gmail_message\".  The workflow should extract order details (buyer name, address, email, contact, product name, quantity) from each email.  This extracted data will be a list, with each element representing a single product ordered within an email. The workflow will then process each item in this list individually.

Reasoning llm : specialized in reasoning and deep thinking. input : llm_prompt. output : reasoning_output (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. If the trigger does not return any output, then the first agent need not be a llm. directly start the main workflow with any agent.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Try to atomize the data flowing between agents into smaller parts to avoid confusion and use them as inputs to the tools. example :- mail_content have sender email, buyer name, product name, quantity, so keep all 4 also in data flow notebook instead of mail_content.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Create a workflow for social media post scheduling using existing social media accounts as the data source.

Reasoning llm : specialized in reasoning and deep thinking. input : llm_prompt. output : reasoning_output (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. If the trigger does not return any output, then the first agent need not be a llm. directly start the main workflow with any agent.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Try to atomize the data flowing between agents into smaller parts to avoid confusion and use them as inputs to the tools. example :- mail_content have sender email, buyer name, product name, quantity, so keep all 4 also in data flow notebook instead of mail_content.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Create a workflow that processes new Gmail messages labeled \"gmail_new_gmail_message\".  If a message concerns a product order, extract the buyer's name, address, contact information, email, product name(s), and quantity(ies). For each product in the order, create a new Notion database entry containing this information.  A separate email will be sent to the relevant vendor for each product. The email will be generated using an LLM and formatted according to the \"VENDORS\" template. The LLM will also determine the vendor's email address based on the product name, as a Google Sheet containing vendor email addresses is unavailable.  The workflow requires manual validation or user input (all). All extracted order information should be added to a Notion database.\n",

codeer_llm, log_summarizer, then a deligator after that. deligator check summarized_logs and delegate back to coder_llm agent if summarized_logs has some errors. \ntry keep no. of delegations to minimum, and only if required.\ndont keep deligator if not asked by user.\n\nNotebook structure:\nShared dictionary with entries fom multiple agents\nEach agent must explicitly declare read/write fields\nPreserve chain-of-thought outputs\n\n\nTrigger to starrt the workflow :-\nTRIGGER_NEW_GMAIL_MESSAGE : Start the workflow when a new Gmail message is received, extract relevant information if it's a product order, and trigger the processing of the order . outputs : ['new_mail_info']\nevery trigger output will be saved to the data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"] if available. if output from trigger not available, then first agent will directly start the workflow\nAvailable tools:-\nGMAIL:-\ngmail_send_mail -> inputs and their defaults: [{'recipient_email': None}, {'subject': None}, {'body': None}, {'is_html': None}, {'attachment': 'file_name'}] , outputs: ['status (True/False)']\n\nNOTION:-\nnotion_create_page_in_page -> inputs and their defaults: [{'parent_page_link': 'url for noton page'}, {'page_title': 'title of new page'}] , outputs: ['status (True/False)', 'new_page_url']\nnotion_insert_row_database -> inputs and their defaults: [{'parent_page_link': 'notion page url in which database exists'}, {'database_name': 'title of database'}, {'row_content': None}] , outputs: ['status']\n\nGOOGLESHEETS:-\nGOOGLESHEETS_GET_SHEET_ROWS -> inputs and their defaults: [{'url': 'this is the url of the sheet'}, {'spreadsheet_name': 'this is the name of the sub sheet'}] , outputs: ['list_of_row_contents (each row content is a list of cell values)']\n\n\n\n\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. validator (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. iterator . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3. deligator. inputs :[deligation_prompt , output of previous agents ]. outputs : {to_deligate_from_p (bool) : True/False , deligation_p : {agent_id : id of agent to which task is to be deligated, changes_required : \"detailed explaination of what changes are required\"}} \n(use deligator to execute a set of agents repeatedly until a condition is met.)\n\n*note -> never use if-else to check if any element available in iterator. iterator handles full process of sending each element to next agents.\n*note -> don't mix delegation and validation. both serve different purposes. use delegation only if required , and use validation for checking conditions.\n\navailable llms:-\n1. coder llm : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. gemini llm : generalized multipurpose llm for general tasks like summarization, etc. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n3. Reasoning llm : specialized in reasoning and deep thinking. input : llm_prompt. output : reasoning_output (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different reasoning llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. If the trigger does not return any output, then the first agent need not be a llm. directly start the main workflow with any agent.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Try to atomize the data flowing between agents into smaller parts to avoid confusion and use them as inputs to the tools. example :- mail_content have sender email, buyer name, product name, quantity, so keep all 4 also in data flow notebook instead of mail_content.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Create a workflow that processes new Gmail messages.  If a message concerns a product order, extract the buyer's name, address, contact information, email, product name(s), and quantity(ies). use validator to check if it is product order. For each product in the order (handling multiple products by creating a new Notion database entry per product), send an email to the relevant vendor for each product.  The email should be generated using an LLM and should only for that product of order.  All extracted order information should be added to a Notion database.  vendor email addresses will need to be determined by the LLM based on the product name and data from google sheet. The workflow requires no manual validation or user input.",

I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. If the trigger does not return any output, then the first agent need not be a llm. directly start the main workflow with any agent.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Create a workflow that processes new Gmail messages.  If a message concerns a product order, extract the buyer's name, address, contact information, email, product name(s), and quantity(ies). use validator to check if it is product order. For each product in the order (handling multiple products by creating a new Notion database entry per product), send an email to the relevant vendor for each product.  The email should be generated using an LLM and should only for that product of order.  All extracted order information should be added to a Notion database.  vendor email addresses will need to be determined by the LLM based on the product name and data from google sheet.

I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. If the trigger does not return any output, then the first agent need not be a llm. directly start the main workflow with any agent.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Create a workflow triggered by new Gmail messages.  The workflow will process emails related to product orders.  For each email, extract the buyer's name, address, contact information, email, product name(s), and quantity(ies). For each product in the order, create a new Notion database entry.  The workflow will utilize a Google Sheet containing a vendor-product map.  For each product, use an LLM to determine the relevant vendor's email address based on the product name and the vendor-product map data in the Google Sheet.  Then, use an LLM to generate an email to the vendor for that specific product, including all extracted order details.  Send the generated email to the determined vendor email address.  The workflow will use Gmail as an input, Notion as an output database, and the Google Sheet as a data source. No manual intervention is required.\n",

REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5.

The workflow should extract text content from incoming emails using an LLM. If the email contains a user query, classify the query into one of the following categories: LOGISTIC, MARKETING, PRODUCT, SPONSORSHIP.  For each classified query, extract the sender's email address and name. Append the sender's email, name, query, and tag to both a Google Sheet and a Notion database.  Finally, generate and send a reply email to the sender acknowledging receipt of their query and confirming its classification. No manual user intervention is required.\n",

DON'T CREATE ANY NON EXISTING TOOL OR ACTION! KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3. DELIGATOR. inputs :[deligation_prompt , output of previous agents ]. outputs : {to_deligate_from_p (bool) : True/False , deligation_p : {agent_id : id of agent to which task is to be deligated, changes_required : \"detailed explaination of what changes are required\"}} \n(use deligator to execute a set of agents repeatedly until a condition is met.)\n\n*note -> never use if-else to check if any element available in iterator. iterator handles full process of sending each element to next agents.\n*note -> don't mix delegation and validation. both serve different purposes. use delegation only if required , and use validation for checking conditions.\n\navailable llms:-\n1. CODER : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Trigger: New Gmail message arrival.

DON'T CREATE ANY NON EXISTING TOOL OR ACTION! KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2.

AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4.

I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Design a periodic workflow (starting daily at 8 AM) that identifies competitors in the crypto-AI market and suggests product improvements.  The workflow should:\n\n1. **Data Acquisition:** Use web scraping and Google Docs API to gather data.  Web scraping will target competitor news, tech releases, and market trends from relevant websites and social media platforms. The Google Docs API will access information about the user's product.\n\n2. **Competitor Identification & Analysis:** Employ a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the gathered data, identifying key competitors in the crypto-AI market.  For each identified competitor, the LLM should summarize key information (e.g., new features, market positioning, strengths, weaknesses).\n\n3. **Improvement Suggestion Generation:**  The separate LLM will generate suggestions for improving the user's product based on competitor analysis and information from the Google Doc.\n\n4. **Notion Page Creation:** An agent will create a new Notion page for each competitor.  The LLM-generated summaries and improvement suggestions will populate the content of each Notion page.\n\n5. **Email Notification:** Finally, an email agent will send a daily email notification at 8 AM summarizing the findings (e.g., list of competitors analyzed, links to Notion pages).  No manual validation or user input is required.\n",

I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query.

I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query.

The trigger will output information about the new email, including sender, subject, body, and a link to any attachments stored in Google Drive. . outputs : ['new_mail_info']\nevery trigger output will be saved to the data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"] if available. if output from trigger not available, then first agent will directly start the workflow\nAvailable tools:- \nGMAIL(Actions):-\nGMAIL_SEARCH_MAIL -> inputs and their defaults: [{'query': None}, {'date_after': None}, {'date_before': None}, {'labels': []}] , outputs: ['list_of_mail_contents each having respective mail_id, mail_subject, attachment link, mail_body']\nGMAIL_SEND_MAIL -> inputs and their defaults: [{'recipient_email': None}, {'subject': None}, {'body': None}, {'is_html': None}, {'attachment': 'file_name'}] , outputs: ['status (True/False)']\n\nGOOGLECALENDAR(Actions):-\nGOOGLECALENDAR_FIND_FREE_SLOTS -> inputs and their defaults: [{'time_min': 'this is the start time of the event'}, {'time_max': 'this is the end time of the event'}] , outputs: ['free_slots (list of free slots in the given time range with each index containing start and end time of the free slots)']\n\nNOTION(Actions):-\nNOTION_CREATE_PAGE_IN_PAGE -> inputs and their defaults: [{'parent_page_link': 'url for noton page'}, {'page_title': 'title of new page'}] , outputs: ['status (True/False)', 'new_page_url']\nNOTION_ADD_ONE_CONTENT_BLOCK_IN_PAGE -> inputs and their defaults: [{'parent_page_link': 'url for noton page'}, {'content_block': 'content to add'}, {'block_property': 'paragraph/heading_1/bulleted_list_item'}] , outputs: ['status']\n\n\nTOOLS WITHOUT ACTIONS:-\nTRANSCRIBE_AUDIO_OR_VIDEO:Transcribe the audio or video file, inputs: ['audio_or_video_file_name'], outputs: ['transcribed_text']\n\nRAG_SEARCH:Semantic search some relevant information from collection of text/image embeddings , also locate the parent file in which the information belongs, inputs: ['query', 'collection_name'], outputs: ['parent_file_name', 'relevant_information']\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT : STRICTLY USE ABOVE TOOLS AND ACTIONS ONLY, NO MATTER THE USER'S PROBLEM IS SOLVED OR NOT! DON'T CREATE ANY NON EXISTING TOOL OR ACTION! KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3. DELIGATOR. inputs :[deligation_prompt , output of previous agents ]. outputs : {to_deligate_from_p (bool) : True/False , deligation_p : {agent_id : id of agent to which task is to be deligated, changes_required : \"detailed explaination of what changes are required\"}} \n(use deligator to execute a set of agents repeatedly until a condition is met.)\n\n*note -> never use if-else to check if any element available in iterator. iterator handles full process of sending each element to next agents.\n*note -> don't mix delegation and validation. both serve different purposes. use delegation only if required , and use validation for checking conditions.\n\navailable llms:-\n1. CODER : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Create an AI workflow triggered by new Gmail messages.  The workflow should process meeting requests from clients addressed to the marketing team. Using Google Calendar API, determine availability for each request.  If available, an LLM will generate a custom reply accepting the meeting, otherwise, it will generate a reply suggesting alternative times.  The workflow will use the Gmail API to send these replies.  Before each meeting, the workflow will access a Notion database (newly created, named \"workflow\") to gather information on the current project status.  An LLM will summarize this information and send it to the user via WhatsApp. During the meeting, the conversation will be transcribed (method to be determined).  After the meeting, the transcript will be saved to the \"workflow\" Notion database. An LLM will then analyze the transcript to extract key insights and store them alongside the transcript in the Notion database.  No manual intervention is required. All data sources (Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion) will be utilized.\n",

The trigger will output information about the new email, including sender, subject, body, and a link to any attachments stored in Google Drive. . outputs : ['new_mail_info']\nevery trigger output will be saved to the data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"] if available. if output from trigger not available, then first agent will directly start the workflow\nAvailable tools:- \nGMAIL(Actions):-\nGMAIL_SEARCH_MAIL -> inputs and their defaults: [{'query': None}, {'date_after': None}, {'date_before': None}, {'labels': []}] , outputs: ['list_of_mail_contents each having respective mail_id, mail_subject, attachment link, mail_body']\nGMAIL_SEND_MAIL -> inputs and their defaults: [{'recipient_email': None}, {'subject': None}, {'body': None}, {'is_html': None}, {'attachment': 'file_name'}] , outputs: ['status (True/False)']\n\nGOOGLECALENDAR(Actions):-\nGOOGLECALENDAR_FIND_FREE_SLOTS -> inputs and their defaults: [{'time_min': 'this is the start time of the event'}, {'time_max': 'this is the end time of the event'}] , outputs: ['free_slots (list of free slots in the given time range with each index containing start and end time of the free slots)']\n\nNOTION(Actions):-\nNOTION_ADD_ONE_CONTENT_BLOCK_IN_PAGE -> inputs and their defaults: [{'parent_page_link': 'url for noton page'}, {'content_block': 'content to add'}, {'block_property': 'paragraph/heading_1/bulleted_list_item'}] , outputs: ['status']\nNOTION_INSERT_ROW_DATABASE -> inputs and their defaults: [{'parent_page_link': 'notion page url in which database exists'}, {'database_name': 'title of database'}, {'row_content': None}] , outputs: ['status']\n\n\nTOOLS WITHOUT ACTIONS:-\nTRANSCRIBE_AUDIO_OR_VIDEO:Transcribe the audio or video file, inputs: ['audio_or_video_file_name'], outputs: ['transcribed_text']\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT : STRICTLY USE ABOVE TOOLS AND ACTIONS ONLY, NO MATTER THE USER'S PROBLEM IS SOLVED OR NOT! DON'T CREATE ANY NON EXISTING TOOL OR ACTION! KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3. DELIGATOR. inputs :[deligation_prompt , output of previous agents ]. outputs : {to_deligate_from_p (bool) : True/False , deligation_p : {agent_id : id of agent to which task is to be deligated, changes_required : \"detailed explaination of what changes are required\"}} \n(use deligator to execute a set of agents repeatedly until a condition is met.)\n\n*note -> never use if-else to check if any element available in iterator. iterator handles full process of sending each element to next agents.\n*note -> don't mix delegation and validation. both serve different purposes. use delegation only if required , and use validation for checking conditions.\n\navailable llms:-\n1. CODER : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Create an AI workflow triggered by new Gmail messages.  The workflow should process meeting requests from clients addressed to the marketing team. Using Google Calendar API, determine availability for each request.  If available, an LLM will generate a custom reply accepting the meeting, otherwise, it will generate a reply suggesting alternative times.  The workflow will use the Gmail API to send these replies.  Before each meeting, the workflow will access a Notion page to gather information on the current project status.  An LLM will summarize this information and send it to the user via WhatsApp. During the meeting, the conversation will be transcribed (method to be determined).  After the meeting, the transcript will be saved to the \"workflow\" Notion database. An LLM will then analyze the transcript to extract key insights and store them alongside the transcript in the Notion database.  No manual intervention is required. All data sources (Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion) will be utilized.\n",

KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3. DELIGATOR. inputs :[deligation_prompt , output of previous agents ]. outputs : {to_deligate_from_p (bool) : True/False , deligation_p : {agent_id : id of agent to which task is to be deligated, changes_required : \"detailed explaination of what changes are required\"}} \n(use deligator to execute a set of agents repeatedly until a condition is met.)\n\n*note -> never use if-else to check if any element available in iterator. iterator handles full process of sending each element to next agents.\n*note -> don't mix delegation and validation. both serve different purposes. use delegation only if required , and use validation for checking conditions.\n\navailable llms:-\n1. CODER : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Trigger: New Gmail message arrival.

AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Trigger: New Gmail message received.\n\nData Sources: Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion.\n\nWorkflow:\n\n1. **Gmail Agent:**  Retrieve the subject and body of the new Gmail message.\n\n2. **Intent Classifier (LLM):** Analyze the email content to classify its intent as:  \"Collaboration Request,\" \"Meeting Time Proposal,\" or \"Hackathon.\"\n\n3. **Collaboration Request Branch (If Intent == \"Collaboration Request\"):**\n    a. **Calendar Agent:** Retrieve the user's free/busy schedule from Google Calendar.\n    b. **Slot Finder Agent:** Identify the next available time slot.\n    c. **Meeting Link Generator Agent:** Create a Google Meet link for the identified time slot.\n    d. **Email Composer (LLM):** Compose a formal email accepting the collaboration request, including the meeting link and time.  The email should be appropriately formatted and professional.\n    e. **Gmail Sender Agent:** Send the composed email to the sender.\n\n4. **Meeting Time Proposal Branch (If Intent == \"Meeting Time Proposal\"):**\n    a. **Time Parser Agent:** Extract the proposed meeting time from the email.\n    b. **Calendar Checker Agent:** Check if the user is free at the proposed time in Google Calendar.\n    c. **Validator (LLM):**  Based on the Calendar Checker's output:\n        i. **If Free:**  Compose a short, formal email replying \"Yes.\"  Send via Gmail Sender Agent.\n        ii. **If Not Free:**  Use Calendar Agent and Slot Finder Agent to find an alternative time slot.  Use Email Composer (LLM) to compose a formal email proposing the alternative time. Send via Gmail Sender Agent.\n\n5. **Hackathon Branch (If Intent == \"Hackathon\"):**\n    a. **Notion Agent:** Add the relevant information from the email (title, description, etc.) to the specified Notion database.\n\n6. **Other Mail Branch (If Intent != \"Collaboration Request\" AND Intent != \"Meeting Time Proposal\" AND Intent != \"Hackathon\"):** Do nothing.\n\nAll email composition by LLMs should adhere to a formal tone and style.  No manual user intervention is required. please use gmail send api to send generated mail\n",

    "prompt": "\nYou are an expert workflow architect specializing in AI agent orchestration. When given a user query, design an ordered list of specialized agents with rectifier checkpoints.  using this structure:\n\n\n{\n\"workflow_name\": (suitable name with spaces between words),\n\"workflow\" (list of agents): [\n{  \"id\": int (1/2/3...),\n    \"type\" : str (tool/llm/connector),\n    \"name\" : str (name of tool/llm/connector),  \n    \"tool_action\" (only for tool agents. keep empty string if no action available for that tool): str (action for that tool) ,\n    \"description\" : str (how the tool/llm/connector will be used to execute the subtask.) ,\n    \"to_execute\" (List with 2 elements)/None: [connector_p,'Y'] if this agent needs to be executed if condition of connector_p is true, [connector_p,'N'] if agent needs to be executed if condition of connector_p is false.  (here p is the last just passed conditional connector id.), None if any connector don't affect this agent.\n    \"config_inputs\" : (dict of inputs required by the agent from the user before workflow execution. example :- {\"link_of_notion_page\":\"put here if available in user query, else keep empty\"}  (these are pre decided inputs, and don't change for different workflow executions)(use config inputs only if any information needed by this tool cannot be found from previous tool outputs)\n    \"data_flow_inputs\" : [\"list of data_flow_notebook_keys this agent reads from\"],\n    \"llm_prompt\" (only for llm agent): \"descriptive prompt containing Core domain expertise , Problem-solving approach , Response logic\", (just keep  prompt, not the output format)\n    \"data_flow_outputs\": [\"list of data_flow_notebook_keys this agent writes to and reads from\"],\n    \"validation_prompt\" (only for validator) : \"detailed Validation criteria\", (just keep  validation criteria, not the output format)\n    \"deligation_prompt\" (only for deligator) : \"detailed deligation criteria\", (just keep  deligation criteria, not the output format)\n    \"available_deligation\" (only for deligator):[\"list of agent ids to which connector can deligate tasks\"]\n},\n(next agents)\n],\n\n\"data_flow_notebook_keys\" : [keep all relevant keys for proper data flow. example:- trigger_output, validator_3, iterator_4, meeting_link_3, etc. ] (keep unique keys only. if id of agent is 3, then all data_flow_output names of this agent will end with _3. example:-  meeting_link_3, etc. )\n\n}\n\n\nDeligation Rules:\nCan delegate tasks to previous relevant agents only\nuse delegation only if required, example :- if there are 2 agents - codeer_llm, log_summarizer, then a deligator after that. deligator check summarized_logs and delegate back to coder_llm agent if summarized_logs has some errors. \ntry keep no. of delegations to minimum, and only if required.\ndont keep deligator if not asked by user.\n\nNotebook structure:\nShared dictionary with entries fom multiple agents\nEach agent must explicitly declare read/write fields\nPreserve chain-of-thought outputs\n\n\nTrigger to starrt the workflow :-\nTRIGGER_NEW_GMAIL_MESSAGE : Start the workflow when a new Gmail message is received. The trigger provides the sender, subject, body, and a link to any attachments stored in Google Drive. . outputs : ['new_mail_info']\nevery trigger output will be saved to the data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"] if available. if output from trigger not available, then first agent will directly start the workflow\nAvailable tools:- \nGMAIL(Actions):-\nGMAIL_SEARCH_MAIL -> inputs and their defaults: [{'query': None}, {'date_after': None}, {'date_before': None}, {'labels': []}] , outputs: ['list_of_mail_contents each having respective mail_id, mail_subject, attachment link, mail_body']\nGMAIL_SEND_MAIL -> inputs and their defaults: [{'recipient_email': None}, {'subject': None}, {'body': None}, {'is_html': None}, {'attachment': 'file_name'}] , outputs: ['status (True/False)']\n\nGOOGLECALENDAR(Actions):-\nGOOGLECALENDAR_FIND_FREE_SLOTS -> inputs and their defaults: [{'time_min': 'this is the start time of the event'}, {'time_max': 'this is the end time of the event'}] , outputs: ['free_slots (list of free slots in the given time range with each index containing start and end time of the free slots)']\n\nGOOGLEMEET(Actions):-\nGOOGLEMEET_CREATE_MEET -> inputs and their defaults: [{'start_datetime': 'this is the start time of the meeting and always in the format of (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)'}, {'event_duration_hour': 'this is the duration of the meeting in hours'}] , outputs: ['google_meet_link']\n\nNOTION(Actions):-\nNOTION_ADD_ONE_CONTENT_BLOCK_IN_PAGE -> inputs and their defaults: [{'parent_page_link': 'url for noton page'}, {'content_block': 'content to add'}, {'block_property': 'paragraph/heading_1/bulleted_list_item'}] , outputs: ['status']\n\n\nTOOLS WITHOUT ACTIONS:-\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT : STRICTLY USE ABOVE TOOLS AND ACTIONS ONLY, NO MATTER THE USER'S PROBLEM IS SOLVED OR NOT! DON'T CREATE ANY NON EXISTING TOOL OR ACTION! KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3. DELIGATOR. inputs :[deligation_prompt , output of previous agents ]. outputs : {to_deligate_from_p (bool) : True/False , deligation_p : {agent_id : id of agent to which task is to be deligated, changes_required : \"detailed explaination of what changes are required\"}} \n(use deligator to execute a set of agents repeatedly until a condition is met.)\n\n*note -> never use if-else to check if any element available in iterator. iterator handles full process of sending each element to next agents.\n*note -> don't mix delegation and validation. both serve different purposes. use delegation only if required , and use validation for checking conditions.\n\navailable llms:-\n1. CODER : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Trigger: New Gmail message received.\n\nData Sources: Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion.\n\nWorkflow:\n\n1. **Gmail Agent:**  Retrieve the subject and body of the new Gmail message.\n\n2. **Intent Classifier (LLM):** Analyze the email content to classify its intent as:  \"Collaboration Request,\" \"Meeting Time Proposal,\" or \"Hackathon.\"\n\n3. **Collaboration Request Branch (If Intent == \"Collaboration Request\"):**\n    a. **Calendar Agent:** Retrieve the user's free/busy schedule from Google Calendar.\n    b. **Slot Finder Agent:** Identify the next available time slot.\n    c. **Meeting Link Generator Agent:** Create a Google Meet link for the identified time slot.\n    d. **Email Composer (LLM):** Compose a formal email accepting the collaboration request, including the meeting link and time.

The trigger provides information about the new email, including sender, subject, body, and a link to any attachments stored in Google Drive. . outputs : ['new_mail_info']\nevery trigger output will be saved to the data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"] if available. if output from trigger not available, then first agent will directly start the workflow\nAvailable tools:- \nGMAIL(Actions):-\nGMAIL_SEARCH_MAIL -> inputs and their defaults: [{'query': None}, {'date_after': None}, {'date_before': None}, {'labels': []}] , outputs: ['list_of_mail_contents each having respective mail_id, mail_subject, attachment link, mail_body']\n\nGOOGLECALENDAR(Actions):-\nGOOGLECALENDAR_FIND_FREE_SLOTS -> inputs and their defaults: [{'time_min': 'this is the start time of the event'}, {'time_max': 'this is the end time of the event'}] , outputs: ['free_slots (list of free slots in the given time range with each index containing start and end time of the free slots)']\n\nGOOGLEMEET(Actions):-\nGOOGLEMEET_CREATE_MEET -> inputs and their defaults: [{'start_datetime': 'this is the start time of the meeting and always in the format of (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)'}, {'event_duration_hour': 'this is the duration of the meeting in hours'}] , outputs: ['google_meet_link']\n\nNOTION(Actions):-\nNOTION_ADD_ONE_CONTENT_BLOCK_IN_PAGE -> inputs and their defaults: [{'parent_page_link': 'url for noton page'}, {'content_block': 'content to add'}, {'block_property': 'paragraph/heading_1/bulleted_list_item'}] , outputs: ['status']\n\n\nTOOLS WITHOUT ACTIONS:-\nRAG_SEARCH:Semantic search some relevant information from collection of text/image embeddings , also locate the parent file in which the information belongs, inputs: ['query', 'collection_name'], outputs: ['parent_file_name', 'relevant_information']\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT : STRICTLY USE ABOVE TOOLS AND ACTIONS ONLY, NO MATTER THE USER'S PROBLEM IS SOLVED OR NOT! DON'T CREATE ANY NON EXISTING TOOL OR ACTION! KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3. DELIGATOR. inputs :[deligation_prompt , output of previous agents ]. outputs : {to_deligate_from_p (bool) : True/False , deligation_p : {agent_id : id of agent to which task is to be deligated, changes_required : \"detailed explaination of what changes are required\"}} \n(use deligator to execute a set of agents repeatedly until a condition is met.)\n\n*note -> never use if-else to check if any element available in iterator. iterator handles full process of sending each element to next agents.\n*note -> don't mix delegation and validation. both serve different purposes. use delegation only if required , and use validation for checking conditions.\n\navailable llms:-\n1. CODER : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Upon receiving a new Gmail message (GMAIL_NEW_GMAIL_MESSAGE trigger):\n\n1. **Email Classifier (LLM):** Analyze the email subject and body to classify it into one of three categories: collaboration request, meeting scheduling request, or hackathon related.\n\n2. **Collaboration Request Handler (if Email Classifier output is \"collaboration request\"):**\n    * **Calendar Accessor:** Retrieve the user's free/busy schedule from Google Calendar.\n    * **Meeting Link Generator:** Generate a meeting link using a suitable platform (e.g., Google Meet).\n    * **Formal Reply Generator (LLM):** Craft a formal email response including the meeting link and relevant details.\n    * **Email Sender:** Send the generated email to the sender.\n\n3. **Meeting Scheduling Request Handler (if Email Classifier output is \"meeting scheduling request\"):**\n    * **Time Parser:** Extract the proposed meeting time from the email.\n    * **Calendar Checker:** Check if the user is free at the proposed time using Google Calendar.\n    * **Response Generator (LLM):**  If free, generate a formal \"yes\" reply. If not free, find alternative free slots using Calendar Accessor and generate a formal email proposing these alternative times.\n    * **Email Sender:** Send the generated email to the sender.\n\n4. **Hackathon Handler (if Email Classifier output is \"hackathon related\"):**\n    * **Notion Updater:** Add the email details (subject, body, sender) to the specified Notion database.\n\n5. **Default Handler (if Email Classifier output is none of the above):** Do nothing.  The workflow will only process emails classified as collaboration requests, meeting scheduling requests, or hackathon-related emails.  All other emails will be ignored.\n",

The workflow will utilize a Google Sheet as its data source.  A Large Language Model (LLM) will generate the content for each post.  A manual validation step is required after content generation, before scheduling. The workflow should incorporate agents to handle content generation (LLM), validation (LLM acting as validator), and scheduling (tool/agent to be specified based on the chosen social media platform).  The workflow should allow for manual intervention at the validation stage.\n",

The trigger provides the sender, subject, body, and a link to any attachments stored in Google Drive. . outputs : ['new_mail_info']\nevery trigger output will be saved to the data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"] if available. if output from trigger not available, then first agent will directly start the workflow\nAvailable tools:- \nGMAIL(Actions):-\nGMAIL_SEARCH_MAIL -> inputs and their defaults: [{'query': None}, {'date_after': None}, {'date_before': None}, {'labels': []}] , outputs: ['list_of_mail_contents each having respective mail_id, mail_subject, attachment link, mail_body']\n\nGOOGLECALENDAR(Actions):-\nGOOGLECALENDAR_FIND_FREE_SLOTS -> inputs and their defaults: [{'time_min': 'this is the start time of the event'}, {'time_max': 'this is the end time of the event'}] , outputs: ['free_slots (list of free slots in the given time range with each index containing start and end time of the free slots)']\n\nGOOGLEMEET(Actions):-\nGOOGLEMEET_CREATE_MEET -> inputs and their defaults: [{'start_datetime': 'this is the start time of the meeting and always in the format of (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)'}, {'event_duration_hour': 'this is the duration of the meeting in hours'}] , outputs: ['google_meet_link']\n\nNOTION(Actions):-\nNOTION_ADD_ONE_CONTENT_BLOCK_IN_PAGE -> inputs and their defaults: [{'parent_page_link': 'url for noton page'}, {'content_block': 'content to add'}, {'block_property': 'paragraph/heading_1/bulleted_list_item'}] , outputs: ['status']\n\n\nTOOLS WITHOUT ACTIONS:-\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT : STRICTLY USE ABOVE TOOLS AND ACTIONS ONLY, NO MATTER THE USER'S PROBLEM IS SOLVED OR NOT! DON'T CREATE ANY NON EXISTING TOOL OR ACTION! KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3.

CODER : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Trigger: New Gmail message received.\n\nData Sources: Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion.\n\nWorkflow:\n\n1. **Gmail Agent:**  Retrieve the subject and body of the new Gmail message.\n\n2. **Intent Classifier (LLM):** Analyze the email content to classify its intent as:  \"Collaboration Request,\" \"Meeting Time Proposal,\" or \"Hackathon.\"\n\n3. **Collaboration Request Branch (If Intent == \"Collaboration Request\"):**\n    a. **Calendar Agent:** Retrieve the user's free/busy schedule from Google Calendar.\n    b. **Slot Finder Agent:** Identify the next available time slot.\n    c. **Meeting Link Generator Agent:** Create a Google Meet link for the identified time slot.\n    d. **Email Composer (LLM):** Compose a formal email accepting the collaboration request, including the meeting link and time.  The email should be appropriately formatted and professional.\n    e. **Gmail Sender Agent:** Send the composed email to the sender.\n\n4. **Meeting Time Proposal Branch (If Intent == \"Meeting Time Proposal\"):**\n    a. **Time Parser Agent:** Extract the proposed meeting time from the email.\n    b. **Calendar Checker Agent:** Check if the user is free at the proposed time in Google Calendar.\n    c. **Validator (LLM):**  Based on the Calendar Checker's output:\n        i. **If Free:**  Compose a short, formal email replying \"Yes.\"  Send via Gmail Sender Agent.\n        ii. **If Not Free:**  Use Calendar Agent and Slot Finder Agent to find an alternative time slot.  Use Email Composer (LLM) to compose a formal email proposing the alternative time. Send via Gmail Sender Agent.\n\n5. **Hackathon Branch (If Intent == \"Hackathon\"):**\n    a. **Notion Agent:** Add the relevant information from the email (title, description, etc.) to the specified Notion database.\n\n6. **Other Mail Branch (If Intent != \"Collaboration Request\" AND Intent != \"Meeting Time Proposal\" AND Intent != \"Hackathon\"):** Do nothing.\n\nAll email composition by LLMs should adhere to a formal tone and style.  No manual user intervention is required.\n",

No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Develop a workflow to automate cold emailing recruiters found on LinkedIn.  The workflow will begin manually. It uses LinkedIn as a data source for recruiter profiles and a file upload (resume) for candidate information. No manual validation steps are required. A Large Language Model (LLM) will generate the cold emails.  The generated emails and recruiter email addresses will be added to a pre-existing Notion table named \"NEW EMAILS\". The workflow should:\n\n1. **Manual Initiation:** The user initiates the workflow.\n\n2. **LinkedIn Recruiter Extraction:** Extract recruiter profiles from LinkedIn (specific details on search criteria will be provided separately).\n\n3. **Resume Upload:** The user uploads their resume as a file.\n\n4. **LLM Cold Email Generation:** For each extracted recruiter profile, use an LLM to generate a personalized cold email. The LLM should consider the job requirements (provided separately) and the content of the uploaded resume to craft each email.  The generated email should be final and require no further assumptions or edits.\n\n5. **Gmail Integration:**  Use the Gmail API to create a new email message in Gmail for each generated email.  The \"To\" field will be populated with the recruiter's email address extracted from LinkedIn. The \"Body\" field will contain the LLM-generated email.\n\n6. **Notion Table Update:**  After each email is generated and added to Gmail, update the \"NEW EMAILS\" Notion table with the generated email text and the recruiter's email address.\n",

I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5.

Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Develop a workflow to automate cold emailing recruiters on LinkedIn.  The workflow will begin manually. It will use both LinkedIn (for recruiter profiles and job descriptions) and a user-uploaded resume (FILE_UPLOAD) as data sources. No manual validation steps are required.  A Large Language Model (LLM) will generate the cold emails.  The generated emails, along with recipient email addresses, will be stored in a Notion table named \"NEW EMAILS\".  For each recruiter found on LinkedIn, the workflow should: 1) Extract the recruiter's email address and associated job description. 2) Use the LLM to generate a complete cold email using the job description and the uploaded resume. 3) Draft the generated email in the Gmail app using Gmail's new message functionality. 4)  Append the generated email content and the recruiter's email address to the \"NEW EMAILS\" Notion table.\n",

This trigger does not produce any output. . outputs : []\nevery trigger output will be saved to the data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"] if available. if output from trigger not available, then first agent will directly start the workflow\nAvailable tools:- \nLINKEDIN(Actions):-\nLINKEDIN_GET_RECRUITER_EMAILS -> input parameters and their explainations: [{'job_title': None}, {'quantity': 10}] , outputs: ['list of hiring posts , which might contain recruiter emails']\n\nGMAIL(Actions):-\nGMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT -> input parameters and their explainations: [{'recipient_email': None}, {'subject': None}, {'body': None}, {'is_html': False}, {'attachment': 'file_local_path'}] , outputs: ['']\n\nNOTION(Actions):-\nNOTION_CREATE_PAGE_IN_PAGE -> input parameters and their explainations: [{'parent_page_link': 'url for noton page'}, {'page_title': 'title of new page'}] , outputs: ['new_page_url']\nNOTION_ADD_ONE_CONTENT_BLOCK_IN_PAGE -> input parameters and their explainations: [{'parent_page_link': 'url for noton page'}, {'content_block': 'content to add'}, {'block_property': 'paragraph/heading_1/bulleted_list_item'}] , outputs: ['status']\nNOTION_INSERT_ROW_DATABASE -> input parameters and their explainations: [{'parent_page_link': 'notion page url in which database exists (important)'}, {'database_name': 'title of notion database (important)'}, {'row_content': None}] , outputs: ['status']\n\n\nTOOLS WITHOUT ACTIONS:-\nFILE_UPLOAD:Take file input from user and upload to server, inputs: [''], outputs: ['file_location_current_directory']\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT : STRICTLY USE ABOVE TOOLS AND ACTIONS ONLY, NO MATTER THE USER'S PROBLEM IS SOLVED OR NOT! DON'T CREATE ANY NON EXISTING TOOL OR ACTION! KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nIMPORTANT : PLEASE KEEP ALL THOSE INPUT PARAMETERS OF ABOVE FUNCTIONS IN CONFIG INPUTS , WHOSE VALUES CANNOT BE FOUND FROM PREVIOUS AGENT OUTPUTS.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3. DELIGATOR. inputs :[deligation_prompt , output of previous agents ]. outputs : {to_deligate_from_p (bool) : True/False , deligation_p : {agent_id : id of agent to which task is to be deligated, changes_required : \"detailed explaination of what changes are required\"}} \n(use deligator to execute a set of agents repeatedly until a condition is met.)\n\n*note -> never use if-else to check if any element available in iterator. iterator handles full process of sending each element to next agents.\n*note -> don't mix delegation and validation. both serve different purposes. use delegation only if required , and use validation for checking conditions.\n\navailable llms:-\n1. CODER : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query.

KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nIMPORTANT : PLEASE KEEP ALL THOSE INPUT PARAMETERS OF ABOVE FUNCTIONS IN CONFIG INPUTS , WHOSE VALUES CANNOT BE FOUND FROM PREVIOUS AGENT OUTPUTS.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3.

AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Develop a workflow to automate cold emailing recruiters on LinkedIn.  The workflow will begin manually. It will use both LinkedIn (for recruiter profiles and job descriptions) and a user-uploaded resume (FILE_UPLOAD) as data sources. No manual validation steps are required.  A Large Language Model (LLM) will generate the cold emails.  The generated emails, along with recipient email addresses, will be stored in a Notion table named \"NEW EMAILS\".  For each recruiter found on LinkedIn, the workflow should: 1) Extract the recruiter's email address and associated job description. 2) Use the LLM to generate a complete cold email using the job description and the uploaded resume. 3) Draft the generated email in the Gmail app using Gmail's new message functionality. 4)  Append the generated email content and the recruiter's email address to the \"NEW EMAILS\" Notion table.\n",

This trigger does not produce any output. . outputs : []\nevery trigger output will be saved to the data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"] if available. if output from trigger not available, then first agent will directly start the workflow\nAvailable tools:- \nLINKEDIN(Actions):-\nLINKEDIN_GET_RECRUITER_EMAILS -> input parameters and their explainations: [{'job_title': None}, {'quantity': 10}] , outputs: ['list of hiring posts , which might contain recruiter emails']\n\nGMAIL(Actions):-\nGMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT -> input parameters and their explainations: [{'recipient_email': None}, {'subject': None}, {'body': None}, {'is_html': False}, {'attachment': 'file_local_path'}] , outputs: ['']\n\nNOTION(Actions):-\nNOTION_CREATE_PAGE_IN_PAGE -> input parameters and their explainations: [{'parent_page_link': 'url for noton page'}, {'page_title': 'title of new page'}] , outputs: ['new_page_url']\nNOTION_ADD_ONE_CONTENT_BLOCK_IN_PAGE -> input parameters and their explainations: [{'parent_page_link': 'url for noton page'}, {'content_block': 'content to add'}, {'block_property': 'paragraph/heading_1/bulleted_list_item'}] , outputs: ['status']\nNOTION_INSERT_ROW_DATABASE -> input parameters and their explainations: [{'parent_page_link': 'notion page url in which database exists (important)'}, {'database_name': 'title of notion database (important)'}, {'row_content': None}] , outputs: ['status']\n\n\nTOOLS WITHOUT ACTIONS:-\nFILE_UPLOAD:Take file input from user and upload to server, inputs: [''], outputs: ['file_location_current_directory']\n\nPDF_TO_TEXT:extract text from pdf file, inputs: ['pdf_file_name'], outputs: ['extracted_text']\nPDF_TO_TEXT:extract text from pdf file, inputs: ['pdf_file_path'], outputs: ['extracted_text']\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT : STRICTLY USE ABOVE TOOLS AND ACTIONS ONLY, NO MATTER THE USER'S PROBLEM IS SOLVED OR NOT! DON'T CREATE ANY NON EXISTING TOOL OR ACTION! KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nIMPORTANT : PLEASE KEEP ALL THOSE INPUT PARAMETERS OF ABOVE FUNCTIONS IN CONFIG INPUTS , WHOSE VALUES CANNOT BE FOUND FROM PREVIOUS AGENT OUTPUTS.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3. DELIGATOR. inputs :[deligation_prompt , output of previous agents ]. outputs : {to_deligate_from_p (bool) : True/False , deligation_p : {agent_id : id of agent to which task is to be deligated, changes_required : \"detailed explaination of what changes are required\"}} \n(use deligator to execute a set of agents repeatedly until a condition is met.)\n\n*note -> never use if-else to check if any element available in iterator. iterator handles full process of sending each element to next agents.\n*note -> don't mix delegation and validation. both serve different purposes. use delegation only if required , and use validation for checking conditions.\n\navailable llms:-\n1. CODER : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Develop a workflow to automate cold emailing recruiters on LinkedIn.

AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Develop a workflow to automate cold emailing recruiters on LinkedIn.  The workflow will begin manually. It will use both LinkedIn (for recruiter profiles and job descriptions) and a user-uploaded resume (FILE_UPLOAD) as data sources. No manual validation steps are required.  A Large Language Model (LLM) will generate the cold emails.  The generated emails, along with recipient email addresses, will be stored in a Notion table named \"NEW EMAILS\".  For each recruiter found on LinkedIn, the workflow should: 1) Extract the recruiter's email address and associated job description. 2) Use the LLM to generate a complete cold email using the job description and the uploaded resume. 3) Draft the generated email in the Gmail app using Gmail's new message functionality. 4)  Append the generated email content and the recruiter's email address to the \"NEW EMAILS\" Notion table.\ni also want to add resume as attachment to gmail tool. so send the path location also to gmail tool\n",

DON'T CREATE ANY NON EXISTING TOOL OR ACTION! KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nIMPORTANT : PLEASE KEEP ALL THOSE INPUT PARAMETERS OF ABOVE FUNCTIONS IN CONFIG INPUTS , WHOSE VALUES CANNOT BE FOUND FROM PREVIOUS AGENT OUTPUTS.\nnote :- if any tool's input is made of outputs from different agents, then keep all those information in data_flow_notebook and use them in the tool as inputs. eg :- row_content can have name,age, mobile_no, etc. So, keep all these in data_flow_notebook instead of row_content.\n\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3. DELIGATOR. inputs :[deligation_prompt , output of previous agents ]. outputs : {to_deligate_from_p (bool) : True/False , deligation_p : {agent_id : id of agent to which task is to be deligated, changes_required : \"detailed explaination of what changes are required\"}} \n(use deligator to execute a set of agents repeatedly until a condition is met.)\n\n*note -> never use if-else to check if any element available in iterator. iterator handles full process of sending each element to next agents.\n*note -> don't mix delegation and validation. both serve different purposes. use delegation only if required , and use validation for checking conditions.\n\navailable llms:-\n1. CODER : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:Monitor Gmail inbox `any` for new emails.

IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:* **Agent:** Gmail Monitor\n    * **Description:** Continuously monitors the inbox of the specified email address for new emails.  Only processes emails that are identified as customer queries (this identification will be handled by a subsequent agent).\n    * **Input:**  The email address to monitor: \"all. but don't do anything for emails other than customer query\" (This requires a more precise definition from the user.  The agent needs a specific email address or a filterable criteria to identify \"customer query\" emails.  This might require a pre-processing step or a more sophisticated email filtering mechanism).\n    * **Output:** A list of new emails identified as customer queries.\n\n* **Agent:** Email Classifier (LLM)\n    * **Description:**  Classifies each email in the input list as either \"technical\" or \"logistics.\"\n    * **Input:** The body of each email from the Gmail Monitor.\n    * **Output:** A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the email body, and a classification label (\"technical\" or \"logistics\").\n\n* **Agent:** Email Sender\n    * **Description:** Sends each classified email to the appropriate recipient email address based on the classification.\n    * **Input:**  A list of dictionaries (from the Email Classifier), each containing the email body and classification label.  A text input tool will be used to define the mapping between classification label and recipient email address.\n    * **Output:** Confirmation of successful email sending for each email.\n\n* **Agent:** Text Input Tool (Email Routing)\n    * **Description:** Allows the user to specify the email addresses to which \"technical\" and \"logistics\" emails should be sent.\n    * **Input:** User-provided email addresses for \"technical\" and \"logistics\" classifications.\n    * **Output:** A dictionary mapping classification labels (\"technical\", \"logistics\") to email addresses.\n\n* **Agent:** Notion Database Updater\n    * **Description:** Adds the processed email information to a new Notion database.\n    * **Input:** A list of dictionaries (from the Email Classifier), each containing the email body, classification label.  An additional agent (Email Parser) will extract customer name and contact information from the email body.\n    * **Output:** Confirmation of successful database update for each email.\n\n* **Agent:** Email Parser (LLM)\n    * **Description:** Extracts the customer name and contact information from the email body.\n    * **Input:** The email body.\n    * **Output:** Customer name and contact information extracted from the email body.  This will require robust LLM prompting to handle variations in email formatting.\n\n\n* **Agent:** Data Aggregator\n    * **Description:** Combines the outputs from the Email Classifier and Email Parser to create a single data structure for the Notion Database Updater.\n    * **Input:** Outputs from Email Classifier and Email Parser.\n    * **Output:** A list of dictionaries, each containing: email body, classification label, customer name, and customer contact information.\n\n* **Agent:** Notion Database Creator (Optional, if database doesn't exist)\n    * **Description:** Creates a new Notion database with the necessary columns.\n    * **Input:**  Database name and column names (provided by the user).\n    * **Output:** The newly created Notion database ID.  This would need to be integrated into the workflow.\n\n\n**Workflow Order:**  Gmail Monitor -> Email Classifier -> Email Parser -> Data Aggregator -> Text Input Tool (Email Routing) -> Email Sender -> Notion Database Updater (Notion Database Creator (if needed) runs before the rest).\n",

No input or automatic triggering is involved. . outputs : []\nevery trigger output will be saved to the data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"] if available. if output from trigger not available, then first agent will directly start the workflow\nAvailable tools:- \nGMAIL(Actions):-\nGMAIL_SEND_EMAIL -> input parameters and their explainations: [{'subject': None}, {'body': None}, {'is_html': False}, {'recipient_email': 'One email address'}, {'attachment': 'file_local_path'}] , outputs: ['']\n\n\nTOOLS WITHOUT ACTIONS:-\nFILE_UPLOAD:Take file input from user and upload to server, returns the location, inputs: [''], outputs: ['file_location_current_directory (Remember it only returns the location of file, not the content)']\n\n\nIMPORTANT : STRICTLY USE ABOVE TOOLS AND ACTIONS ONLY, NO MATTER THE USER'S PROBLEM IS SOLVED OR NOT! DON'T CREATE ANY NON EXISTING TOOL OR ACTION! KEEP ONLY THOSE TOOLS/ACTIONS WHICH WILL EXACTLY SOLVE USER'S PROBLEM.\nIMPORTANT : PLEASE KEEP ALL THOSE INPUT PARAMETERS OF ABOVE FUNCTIONS IN CONFIG INPUTS , WHOSE VALUES CANNOT BE FOUND FROM PREVIOUS AGENT OUTPUTS.\n\n\navailable connectors:-\n1. VALIDATOR (conditional connector). inputs : [validation_prompt , output from previous agent]. outputs : {validator_p (bool) (p is the id, value will be true if validation is true)}\n2. ITERATOR . inputs: [list_of_something]. output : [list_element (one at a time)] (use this when need to pass something to next tools one by one from a list. use iterator just after the tool which returns a list of elements)\n3. DELIGATOR. inputs :[deligation_prompt , output of previous agents ]. outputs : {to_deligate_from_p (bool) : True/False , deligation_p : {agent_id : id of agent to which task is to be deligated, changes_required : \"detailed explaination of what changes are required\"}} \n(use deligator to execute a set of agents repeatedly until a condition is met.)\n\n*note -> never use if-else to check if any element available in iterator. iterator handles full process of sending each element to next agents.\n*note -> don't mix delegation and validation. both serve different purposes. use delegation only if required , and use validation for checking conditions.\n\navailable llms:-\n1. CODER : code generation. input : llm_prompt. output : {\"code\":generated_code, \"language\":language of code}.\n2. AI : generalized multipurpose llm for general text generation. input : llm_prompt. output : generated content (all required outputs in json format)\n\nif the user's query involves some planning or reasoning requirements, use reasoning llm for that part. example:-\n- if user wants to create a plan for a software project, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like product manager, solution architect, financial planner, project manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a business, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like business analyst, financial planner, marketing manager, etc.\n- if user wants to create a plan for a trip, use different gemini llm's for different tasks like requirements identifier, travel planner, financial planner, etc.\n\nSOME RULES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY :-\n\n1. I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:* **TRIGGER:** Manually initiates the workflow.\n\n* **CSV Reader:** Reads the provided CSV file (filename will be provided manually).

I already know the trigger, so don't give trigger, trigger is not a tool, so find the tools which will be used strictly after the trigger. example if using gmail trigger ,then no need to use gmail_search_mail.\n2. IF TRIGGER RETURNS ANY OUTPUT, THEN THE FIRST AGENT MAY BE LLM, IT SHOULD TAKE INPUT FROM THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT (data_flow_notebook[\"trigger_output\"]) and extract the required information from it.\n3. REMEMBER, MANUAL_TRIGGER HAS NO OUTPUTS. IT IS JUST USED TO START THE WORKFLOW WITH EMPTY data_flow_notebook.\n4. Strictly make sure that config inputs will be included only if that input cannot be found out from previous tool outputs !! \n5. Must use iterator if you need to pass something to next tools one by one from previous output.\n6. return a output in json format which will be used to execute the workflow, given the user query. No preambles or postambles are required. Keep all strings in double quotes.\n\nWORKFLOW TO CREATE:* **TRIGGER:** Manually initiates the workflow.  (Starts the process)\n\n* **FILE_UPLOAD:** The user uploads the CSV file containing student data. (Gets the CSV file)\n\n* **CSV_READER:** Reads the uploaded CSV file and converts it into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a student's data. (Processes the CSV data)\n\n* **AI (LLM):**  This LLM filters the list of dictionaries to select only students whose college is \"NIT Raipur\".  The output is a filtered list of student dictionaries.  The prompt should specify: \"Filter the following list of student dictionaries to include only those where the 'college' field is 'NIT Raipur'. Return the filtered list.\" (Filters students from NIT Raipur)\n\n* **ITERATOR:** Iterates through the filtered list of student dictionaries, passing each student's data to the next agent one by one. (Iterates through the filtered list)\n\n* **AI (LLM):** This LLM generates a personalized email reminder for each student. The input is a single student's dictionary. The prompt should be: \"Generate a personalized email reminder for a hackathon, addressing the student by their name (from the 'name' field) and mentioning their college (from the 'college' field).  Include the hackathon details (date, time, location -  you can hardcode these details in the prompt). The output should be a JSON object with 'subject' and 'body' fields containing the email subject and body respectively.\" (Generates personalized emails)\n\n* **GMAIL:** Sends the email generated by the LLM. The input is the JSON object containing the email subject and body, and the student's email address (from the 'email' field in the student dictionary). (Sends the emails)\n\n",
